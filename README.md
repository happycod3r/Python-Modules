# Python3 Modules

This is a collection of Python 3 modules that I have written for use in my own projects and 
that I found useful and reusable.

## Persistence

> Documentation for the persistence module can be found here: [persistence](./docs/PERSISTENCE.md)

The `persistence` module contains a class that wraps the configparser module.

## Stdops

> Documentation for the stdops module can be found here: [stdops](./docs/STDOPS.md)

The `stdops` module provides functions for dealing with files and directories.

## YouTube API Tools

> Documentation for the youtube_api_tools module can be found here: [youtube_api_tools](./docs/YOUTUBE_API_TOOLS.md)

The `youtube_api_tools` module houses the `YouTubeAPIClient` class which
contains methods for interacting with the YouTube API such as working with 
playlists or videos. 
The YouTubeAPIClient class sets up the OAuth 2.0 flow using your client_secret.json 
file, and will handle user authentication and token retrieval.

### Reporting a vulnerability or bug?

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: A general rule of thumb is to never publicly report bugs or vulnerabilities because you might inadvertently reveal it to unethical people who may use it for bad. Instead, you can email me directly at: [paulmccarthy676@gmail.com](mailto:paulmccarthy676@gmail.com). I will deal with the issue privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
